# Blur detection using 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
This is a project in ele510@UiS

*Details*: Explain the theory of 2D DFT. Explain how it is useful and/or some examples of applications. Show how to detect if an 
image is blurry or not. in Explain and perform some experiments with your own images.
