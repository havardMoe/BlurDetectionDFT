# Blur detection using 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
This is a project in ele510@UiS --- ![Overleaf report](https://www.overleaf.com/project/6363b4966c1a160376e8d83b)

*Details*: Explain the theory of 2D DFT. Explain how it is useful and/or some examples of applications. Show how to detect if an 
image is blurry or not. in Explain and perform some experiments with your own images. 



### Proposed plan

1. Read about & Understand 2D DFT
2. Explain how it is useful, and some usecases
  * Maybe show an example of a simple usecase
3. Do some experimenting with images with different level of blurs
4. Find an to detect if the image is blurry or not based on the DFT output
  * Try and draw some conclusions.
5. Visualize and present the results
